## A project of commons

To make it short; yes you can contribute! The `agentname` uses `LGPL-2.1-only`,
to make sure the code stay open and free.

The code is provided as a share of ideas, not as a private repo, but neither as
a fully public repo. It is for testing ideas, not for production code. The code
is already built on other peoples ideas, it is expected others may further
build upon it. Don't limit them.

If you want to share your contributions, the way to do it is to create your own
clone of the repository and make pull requests from branches you create in your
own repository. Please respect use of linters, and you should also lint your
own code.
