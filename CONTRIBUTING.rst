Contributing
============

To make it short; yes you can contribute! The `agentname` uses `LGPL-3.0-only`, to make sure the code stay open and free.

The code is provided as a share of ideas, not as a private repo, but neither as a fully public repo. It is for testing ideas, not for production code. It is already built on other peoples ideas, it is expected others may build upon this.

If you want to share your contributions, the way to do it is to create your own clone of the repository and make pull requests from branches you create in your own repository. Please respect use of linters, and you should also check your own code.

Note that I might choose at some point to change the license for the whole or parts of the repository.
